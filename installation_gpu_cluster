# here i publish the algorithm to install it on kaust ibex gpu cluster
# as i remember it the next day after doing installation manually

1) make conda installation in your home directory on ibex
2) activate conda by sourcing basrc file

conda create -n myenv python=3.9
module load cuda/11.2.2
conda install gxx_linux-64
module load gcc/6.4.0
pip3 install torch --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
pip install deepwave

it should work smoothly
